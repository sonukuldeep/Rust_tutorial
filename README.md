# Objective
Learn rust via [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example)

## Rust
Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

## Rust by example
Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. 

## Topics that will be covered

- [x] Primitives - Learn about signed integers, unsigned integers and other primitives.
- [ ] Custom Types - struct and enum.
- [x] Variable Bindings - mutable bindings, scope, shadowing.
- [ ] Types - Learn about changing and defining types.
- [ ] Conversion
- [ ] Expressions
- [ ] Flow of Control - if/else, for, and others.
- [ ] Functions - Learn about Methods, Closures and Higher Order Functions.
- [ ] Modules - Organize code using modules

- [ ] Attributes - An attribute is metadata applied to some module, crate or item.
- [ ] Generics - Learn about writing a function or data type which can work for multiple types of arguments.
- [ ] Scoping rules - Scopes play an important part in ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- [ ] Traits - A trait is a collection of methods defined for an unknown type: Self
- [ ] Macros
